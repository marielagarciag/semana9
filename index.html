                <h2 class="h2index">Coral Reef Restoration</h2> 
              	<p class="pindex"> Coral reefs around the world are under increased threats due to both local and global stresses, making coral reef restoration more vital to preserve marine resources and local economies. Generally, there are two main types of coral restoration, known as Active and Passive Restoration. Active coral restoration refers to projects whereby time, energy, and resources are devoted to directly increasing the coral reef health, abundance, or biodiversity. Together these three factors constitute what is referred to as the coral reef resilience. A reef which has a high abundance of corals that are healthy and formed from a diverse range of coral genera is said to be resilient, or able to withstand or recover from disturbances. <br> Ideally, active restoration is done after passive restoration, or the creation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has already been accomplished. The most common objectives of active restoration are to restore habitat and corals which have been lost, or improve reef resilience to mitigate future disturbances. In order to restore an ecosystem effectively, the threat must first be reduced or eliminated. But, in an increasing number of areas around the world today, the likelihood of stopping the consortium of imposing threats is minimal. In these areas, restoration to improve resilience must be implemented to reduce the degree of damage and maintain small areas of the reef to serve as ‘biodiversity banks. <br> Charles Darwin has been given credit as being the world’s first coral restorationist. What he realized was that corals dislodged by boat grounding or anchors often died after rolling around or being abraded by sand. Using that observation, he theorized that by securing the coral in place it should recover and regrow. He tested this theory by pounding pieces of bamboo into the sand and tying the unsecured coral fragments to it. After observing the corals over time, he determined that in doing so the coral not only survived, but began to regrow and replace lost tissue areas through the asexual reproduction of coral polyps.</p>
